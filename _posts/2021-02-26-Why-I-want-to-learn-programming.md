I am studying Creative Technology, and I learned a programming also. But the date that I decided to go for programming study is not a long time ago. Here, I would like to explain why I learn a programming.  

## Idea to Real product ðŸ’¡
I like to make an idea. I was always the one who started a idea, and in the project, I was happy to work with other team members to realize the idea. But when I am alone, even though I have a bunch of idea that I would like to present, it was still just a idea, not a real things that can be presented. When the idea is not realized, it is just an idea. Nothing. So when I realized how programming is powerful, I was so happy to learn about this.

## Help others by Learning ðŸ˜Ž
There are various programming teachers on internet, for free! I learned a lot by googling, and I also wanted to be the one who can share the knowledge. I owe to others, so now I am ready to share also. 

## possibility to change and grow. 
This might also a biggest challenge when people learn programming, but I think there is some space always you can grow when you learn a programming. It is super difficult to decide which direction you need to go, but as long as you don't give up, you can continue to learn and grow your knowledge as well. 

My english writing also still has a space to improve. If you find any points that is hard to understand, you can let me know by comments. I am writing down in English to develop my english writing as well. Thanks for reading!
